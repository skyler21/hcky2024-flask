Flask App Docker Image
This Docker image contains a simple Flask web application that displays the hostname and IP address of the container. The application consists of an index page and an error page.

Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine (Install Docker)
Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

Open a terminal.

Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and source code.

Run the following command:

docker build -t your-username/flask-app:latest -f Dockerfile .
Replace your-username with your DockerHub username or the desired repository name.

Understanding the Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is designed for a production environment and follows best practices for building a Python Flask application.

Base Image
We use the official Python 3.11 Alpine image as the base image. This image is lightweight and suitable for production.

Environment Variables
We set environment variables to configure Python behavior:

PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE: Prevents Python from writing pyc files to disk.
PYTHONUNBUFFERED: Ensures Python output is sent directly to terminal without buffering.
Working Directory
We create and set the working directory inside the container to /app.

Install Dependencies
We copy only the requirements.txt file first to leverage Docker caching and install Python dependencies.

Copy Source Code
We copy the entire application source code to the working directory.

Expose Port
We expose port 8080, the port on which the Flask application will run.

Command to Run
We specify the command to run on container start: python src/app.py.

Pushing the Docker Image to DockerHub
To push the Docker image to DockerHub, run the following command:

docker push your-username/flask-app:latest
Replace your-username with your DockerHub username or the desired repository name.

Running the Docker Container
To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

docker run -p 8080:8080 your-username/flask-app:latest
Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to see the Flask app.

Note: You can customize the port and tag as needed.
